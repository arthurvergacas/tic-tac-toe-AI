# Tic Tac Toe - AI

## With Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This is a simple application of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> algorithm in a Tic-Tac-Toe game made with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Pygame</a>.

The Minimax also has the Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization, wich allows faster plays by the AI.

Feel free to look the code and maybe understand more the minimax algorithm
